    <html><body><p>Usually in software, version numbers tend to go up, not down. With AlphaGo Zero, we did the opposite - by taking out handcrafted human knowledge, we ended up with both a simpler and more beautiful algorithm and a stronger Go program.</p>
<p>We provide a full description in our paper, <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v550/n7676/full/nature24270.html">Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge</a>, which you can also <a href="http://rdcu.be/wRUY">read online</a>.</p>
<p>At the core is a self-improvement loop based on self-play and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): We start with a randomly initialized network, then use this network in the MCTS to play the first games. The network is continuously trained on the latest played games, and recent snapshots of the network are used to play new games.</p>
<p>Of course, the initial games will be made up of completely random moves (as the network doesn't know anything yet). However, even these random games already serve to teach the network …</p></body></html>

No only did we play the legendary Ke Jie, but there were also two new and exciting formats: Team Go and Pair Go.</p>
<p>This match was also very exciting on the technical side because we had improved AlphaGo to the point where we ran it on <a href="https://youtu.be/Z-HL5nppBnM?t=6h3m19s">a single machine in the Google Cloud</a><sup><a href="/cache/blog_2017_06_18_alphago-in-china/youtu.be_Z-HL5nppBnM?t=6h3m19s/youtu.be/z-hl5nppbnm/index.html">cache</a></sup> - that's <a href="https://youtu.be/Z-HL5nppBnM?t=6h3m55s">one tenth of the computation power</a><sup><a href="/cache/blog_2017_06_18_alphago-in-china/youtu.be_Z-HL5nppBnM?t=6h3m55s/youtu.be/z-hl5nppbnm/index.html">cache</a></sup> compared to the distributed version we used in the last match!</p>
<p>Personally, I also really enjoyed the Pair Go format, both when I tried it myself and watching the game with professional players.</p>
<p>But first things first, let's start with the games against Ke Jie. As expected, these were some of the highest quality games of Go I had ever seen, really exciting to watch.</p>

<p>This time the fitbit alta HR and the Polar H10 agreed much more closely, even during an hour of running! It also correctly detected the drop in heart rate in the middle of my run when I stopped for a bit.</p>
<p>So while not accurate enough for serious heart rate tracking during exercise (for that I still recommend a chest strap like the Polar H10), the fitbit is definitely good enough for 24/7 monitoring and more casual tracking during exercise.</p></body></html>

  </div>
  <div id="article_text">
    <html><body><p>As promised in the previous post, I made another attempt at getting more accurate readings from the fitbit. The good news is that wearing it tighter does seem to improve the sensor readings. The bad news is that I'm not sure if this tightness is comfortable in the long run, we'll see.</p>
<p>The following was recorded while grocery shopping, cooking and eating Salmon Teriyaki bowls and some reading:</p>
<p><a href="/images/polar_vs_fitbit_2.png"><img alt="Chart showing heart rate as measured by Polar H10 vs fitbit alta HR" src="/images/polar_vs_fitbit_2.png"/></a></p>
<p>The two peaks in heart rate correspond to me walking to and from the grocery shop. Curiously the fitbit once again exaggerated my actual pulse; this time though there was definitely no stray light (I wore the fitbit tight against the skin, under a long sleeved shirt and a coat).</p>
<p>I'll perform some more experiments tomorrow with wearing the fitbit in reverse, i.e. with the sensor against the bottom of my arm.</p></body></html>

  <div id="article_text">
    <html><body><p>Recently I acquired one of the new fitbit alta HR bands, mainly because it promised to track my heart rate 24/7 without the need to wear any chest strap.</p>
<p>I always expected this to be less accurate than a chest strap, but how much less? I also happen to have a Polar H10 chest strap (which I use when running), so I decided to record with both for an extended period today.</p>
<p>The results are below (click for the full image):</p>
<p><a href="/images/polar_vs_fitbit.png"><img alt="Chart showing heart rate as measured by Polar H10 vs fitbit alta HR" src="/images/polar_vs_fitbit.png"/></a></p>
<p>The fitbit is in blue, the Polar strap in green. There are a few gaps in the data for the Polar strap because I recorded in parts with an app on my phone, which ran out of batter at some point.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough the fitbit actually overestimates my heart rate. If anything, I'd have expected the opposite, because it's easier to miss heart beats with an optical sensor …</p></body></html>

    <html><body><p>I recently bought a new laptop because my trusty old Thinkpad (x230) finally got a bit too old for my taste (apart from the battery it still works perfectly though!).</p>
<p>After a lot of searching around and gnashing of teeth - how can current laptops be barely faster than my 4 year old Thinkpad?! And what do you mean, the laptop comes with at most 16 GB of RAM and I can't even upgrade it?!</p>
<p>Finally, I settled on the <a href="http://www.dell.com/uk/p/alienware-13-laptop/pd?ref=PD_OC">Alienware 13</a>.</p>

Since I'm partial to a bit of machine learning, that kind of performance was very enticing. It's also fully upgradeable - 2 m2 slots for SSDs, as well as 2 SO-DIMMs for RAM.</p>

  </div>
  <div id="article_text">
    <html><body><p>I just read an <a href="http://ashtonkemerling.com/blog/2017/01/26/java-without-if/">article</a> linked on Hacker News advocating the use of <code>Either&lt;L, R&gt;</code> to signal errors in functions. While I think this is a good start, in my experience <code>Either</code> is too general, the lack of standardizing of the error value makes error handling abstractions hard. How did that file function signal again that a file was not found?</p>
<p>What works a lot better in my experience is a more specialized type <code>Status</code>, with a standardized enum of error codes and a free form error message.</p>

    <html><body><p><a href="http://amzn.to/2dM5Ncu">Work Rules!</a> is the title of a great book by Laszlo Bock, SVP of People Operations at Google.</p>
<p>It's a pretty accurate portrait of life at Google (at least from what I've seen over the last three years), and at the same time it is a great guidebook for companies that haven't yet come as far along the path of employee empowerment.</p>
<p>If you are in any way involved with work - be it employer or employee - this is a must read, with lots of practical advice on how to improve your organization (and your life!).

At 300 reviews a day that's a lot of typing!</p>
<p>Today I finally had enough. First I considered making a user script for WaniKani to make it work a bit more like Anki (where you don't type the answer at all, you simply indicate how well you knew it with one tap). But then I realized that I might as well just use Anki directly.</p>
<p>I quickly found <a href="https://wanikanitoanki.com/">wanikanitoanki.com</a><sup><a href="/cache/blog_2016_07_30_wanikani-on-anki/wanikanitoanki.com/wanikanitoanki.com/index.html">cache</a></sup>, which is great to export all Radicals, Kanji and Vocabulary and has really nice Anki templates too. Alas, the exported data didn't include the critical mnemonics! Presumably because these aren't returned by WaniKani's API.</p>
